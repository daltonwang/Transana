""" A Message Server that processes inter-instance communication between Transana-MU
    clients.  This server utility enables synchronization of the Data Windows. """

# NOTE:  Major rewrite started on 12/19/2005.  To work as a Service on Windows, we really need all of this
#        instantiated in a class instead of just thrown out there in flat, linear code

# As of September 10, 2014, there are problems using SSL to connect to the Transana Message Server on OS X.
#
# I've experimented extensively with Python 2.6.7, Python 2.7.8, and Python 3.4.1.
# Python 2.6.7 and Python 2.7.8 have a problem in the Python ssl module that prevents them from connecting to the
# Transana Message Server correctly from OS X if the Certificate files were created on Ubuntu 14.04.  Python 3.4.1
# doesn't have this problem.  However, there is not currently a version of wxPython for Python 3.4.1 that supports
# all of the widgets that Transana requires.  Certificate files created on Windows 7 and on OS X 10.7.5 work fine.
#
# I have modified the Transana Message Server to handle both SSL and non-SSL connections at the same time.

# Daemon code based on http://www.jejik.com/articles/2007/02/a_simple_unix_linux_daemon_in_python/

# The MySQL web site describes creating the necessary files at http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/creating-ssl-certs.html

#
# openssl genrsa 2048 > ca-key.pem
# openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -days 3600 -key ca-key.pem -out ca-cert.pem
# openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -days 3600 -nodes -keyout server-key.pem -out server-req.pem
# openssl rsa -in server-key.pem -out server-key.pem
# openssl x509 -req -in server-req.pem -days 3600 -CA ca-cert.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -set_serial 01 -out server-cert.pem
# openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -days 3600 -nodes -keyout client-key.pem -out client-req.pem

# openssl x509 -req -in client-req.pem -days 3600 -CA ca-cert.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -set_serial 01 -out client-cert.pem

# These commands generate the necessary certificate files for using SSL, as described at
# http://carlo-hamalainen.net/blog/2013/1/24/python-ssl-socket-echo-test-with-self-signed-certificate :
#
# openssl genrsa -des3 -out transanamessageserver.orig.key 2048
